# 🖼️ AI Image Classifier Web App

This project is a simple yet powerful **AI-powered Image Classifier** built with **Python, Scikit-learn, and Gradio**. It allows users to upload an image and get real-time predictions based on the trained model.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 🔧 Option 1: Run Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-classifier.git
cd image-classifier
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

### 🔧 Option 2: Run in Google Colab

> Open `train_model.ipynb` in Colab  
> Run all cells and launch the Gradio app using:

```python
app.launch(share=True)
```
